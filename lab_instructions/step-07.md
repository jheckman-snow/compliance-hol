# Step 7: Review and Lab Completion

[← Previous: Step 6](step-06.md) | [Back to Index](../README.md)

Congratulations! You have successfully completed the Global Risk Company Snowflake Intelligence HOL. Let's review what we've accomplished and complete any final steps.

## Lab Summary

This lab explored Snowflake Intelligence and its applications for AI-powered compliance intelligence. You've built a comprehensive platform that demonstrates Global Risk Company's progressive data integration strategy.

### What We Accomplished

**Data Foundation (Steps 1-2):**
1. **Structured Data Ingestion**: Loaded client organizations and audit events (CSV format)
2. **Semi-Structured Data Processing**: Integrated security incident reports (JSON format) with structured view creation
3. **External Data Integration**: Connected regulatory intelligence via Snowflake Data Sharing
4. **AI-Powered Analysis**: Used Cortex AISQL functions for intelligent regulatory analysis

**AI Intelligence Layer (Steps 3-7):**
3. **Snowflake Intelligence Setup**: Configured metadata and permissions with semantic model creation
4. **Cortex Search Service**: Created document search for external regulatory content
5. **Comprehensive Agent**: Built single agent with access to all data sources
6. **Comprehensive Testing**: Validated cross-source intelligence across structured and unstructured data
7. **Lab Review**: Summary and completion validation

### Key Technical Achievements

**Multi-Format Data Integration:**
- Structured CSV files with relational modeling (client organizations, audit events)
- Semi-structured JSON data with VARIANT columns, LATERAL FLATTEN, and structured views (security incidents)
- External regulatory data via Snowflake Data Sharing
- Unstructured document content via Cortex Search

**AI-Enhanced Capabilities:**
- Natural language querying across multiple data formats
- Semantic relationship modeling and intelligent joins
- Cross-referencing internal compliance with external regulations
- Document content search with source attribution

**Real-World Business Value:**
- Automated compliance gap analysis
- Industry-specific regulatory recommendations  
- Risk prioritization based on multiple data dimensions
- Intelligent cross-referencing for regulatory updates

## Business Impact

Global Risk Company's platform now demonstrates:

- **Faster Compliance Analysis**: Analysts can query complex compliance data using natural language
- **Comprehensive Intelligence**: Single interface for structured operations data and unstructured regulatory content
- **Proactive Risk Management**: AI-powered cross-referencing identifies compliance gaps automatically
- **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add new data sources and expand to additional regulatory frameworks

## Advanced Extensions

Organizations can extend this foundation to include:
- **Real-time Regulatory Monitoring**: Automated alerts for new compliance requirements
- **Predictive Risk Assessment**: ML models for compliance risk scoring
- **Third-Party Integration**: Connect additional compliance tools and data sources
- **Custom Compliance Frameworks**: Industry-specific semantic models and search services

## Optional: DORA Validation

**For Snowflake employees in the SE organization only:**

Run these commands in Snowsight to confirm your completion:
- [Greeter Script for DORA](https://www.google.com/search?q=/config/SE_GREETER.sql)
- [Grading Script for DORA](https://www.google.com/search?q=/config/DoraGrading.sql)

## Environment Cleanup

### Reset Default Settings

We recommend resetting your default role and warehouse to `ACCOUNTADMIN`:

1. **Reset Default Role**: In Snowsight user profile, set default role back to `ACCOUNTADMIN`
2. **Reset Default Warehouse**: Set appropriate default warehouse for other labs

### Optional: Preserve Lab Environment

To keep your Global Risk Compliance Agent for future use:
- Leave all databases and semantic models in place
- Keep the Cortex Search service active
- Maintain agent configuration for ongoing testing

## Next Steps

**For Further Learning:**
- Explore additional Cortex AISQL functions for advanced text analysis
- Experiment with different semantic model configurations
- Try building agents for other business domains
- Investigate Cortex Analyst for additional AI capabilities

**For Production Implementation:**
- Design data governance policies for multi-source intelligence
- Implement proper access controls and role-based permissions
- Plan for scalable data sharing agreements with regulatory providers
- Develop standardized compliance monitoring workflows
